# arabxetex
An ArabTeX-like interface for XeLaTeX

## CTAN Package
 https://www.ctan.org/pkg/arabxetex



## Maintenance
Vafa Khalighi, who was maintaining xepersian with François Charette,
handed maintenance of all of his packages to to this bidi-tex GitHub Group
(which initially consisted of members of the LaTeX3 team).


Note that François also maintains xe on GitHub

https://github.com/fc7/arabxetex


So possibly this repository will be deleted and issues should be
raised there, the details are still to be arranged.

The current files my be retrieved from CTAN:
