-----

This repository was set up alongside all the bid-tex repositories
when Vafa Khalighi, who was listed as a co-maintainer,
handed maintenance of all of his packages to to this bidi-tex GitHub Group
(which initially consisted of members of the LaTeX3 team).


This repository may be be deleted in the future but we will keep the this README
here for the time being.
